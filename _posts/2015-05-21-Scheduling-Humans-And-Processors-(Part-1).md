## TL;DR
You need to prioritize tasks, some have deadlines, some don't.  Some have priorities, some do not. Switching between tasks to get everything done sucks... now what...?  CPUs have solved this for us (sorta...)!

## Step 1, Getting Things Done (GTD)
Lets say you have a bunch of tasks to do and you really just want to clear out as many of those tasks as possible in the shortest amount of time possible. Then here's the solution, we just finish off all tasks that take the least amount of time first!  That way, we'll clear out a lot of tasks in a small range of time. This is known as ["Shortest Job First" (SJF) or "Shortest Job Next" (SJN)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_job_next).  Intuitively, if we take tasks that take a small amount of time to finish, we can fit more tasks in a certain time period that if we took a couple of really big tasks.

Sounds okay? Not really. You may be finishing a lot of your tasks but you're still putting off the big tasks.  You might even never get to them if you follow this policy. If short tasks keep coming in, then you might never actually do your long task.  Thats no good... you'll miss the deadline for the long running task (assuming it has one).


## Step 2, Multi-Tasking
So our GTD approach lets us finish a lot of tasks but leaves us with no time for the big projects. Lets instead, multi-task!  We can divide out time into equal time slots and assign each of the slots to one task. That way, every task will eventually be complete and short tasks will be still be finished quicker. What we have here is ["Round Robin Scheduling"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_scheduling).

We're now at the point where short tasks will still finish quicker than the long tasks and the long tasks will still eventually be finished! Even though we might not get as many tasks done as our GTD approach, at least everything will eventually be finished, sounds like a good compromise.  Not quite....

Although its a good compromise, you'll be switching between tasks all the time. You're _human_ and you _can't multi-task_. Processors can multi-task but just like humans, there's a cost.  We've all heard about people having to get into the 'groove' and how it has a ramp up time.  Same with processors. When we switch between tasks, its called a ["Context Switch"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch) and there's almost always a cost, a loss of that 'groove'.
