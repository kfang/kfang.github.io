## TL;DR
You need to prioritize tasks, some have deadlines, some don't.  Some have priorities, some do not. Switching between tasks to get everything done sucks... now what...?  CPUs have solved this for us (sorta...)!

## Step 1, Getting Things Done (GTD)
Lets say you have a bunch of tasks to do and you really just want to clear out as many of those tasks as possible in the shortest amount of time possible. Then here's the solution, we just finish off all tasks that take the least amount of time first!  That way, we'll clear out a lot of tasks in a small range of time. This is known as ["Shortest Job First" (SJF) or "Shortest Job Next" (SJN)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_job_next).  Intuitively, if we take tasks that take a small amount of time to finish, we can fit more tasks in a certain time period that if we took a couple of really big tasks.

Sounds okay? Not really. You may be finishing a lot of your tasks but you're still putting off the big tasks.  You might even never get to them if you follow this policy. If short tasks keep coming in, then you might never actually do your long task.  Thats no good... you'll miss the deadline for the long running task (assuming it has one).
